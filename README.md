## GAME DESCRIPTION:
  
  Run across the city avoiding the obstacles and unleash the caos killing as many peaople as possible until the zombie arrives to the end of the map or dies.

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

The game has a gravity that pulls the character to the ground, that by the moment, hasd no hitbox and it is a fix int. The jump gives the character some vertical velocity so it goes up and down smoothly. The gravity disappears with the God Mode so the player can move freely at any direction and stay in the mid of the air if it is wanted.

When pressing F1, the red squares indicate the places where the character will be able to walk through and the green ones, where he will die, otherwise, if the character arrives at the end of the map, he will get blocked and win.

The camera is programmed in a way that it gets blocked if the character is arriving at the end of the map so it does not show the blank after the map

Saving and loading the game works on the same session or even after closing the game.

The program has "FPS limiter", "Frame Counter" and the "Vsync" is on.
